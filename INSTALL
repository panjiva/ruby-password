At the prompt, type:

$ ruby extconf.rb

This will create a Makefile for your system.

Next, type:

$ make

This will build the software for your system.

Finally, type:

$ make install

This will install the software on your system. The software consists of
crack.so, a low level shared object interface to LibCrack for checking
password security stength, and password.rb, a higher level API for dealing
with passwords.

If, for any reason, you wish to install the software elsewhere, you can
pass make(1) relevant arguments via environment variables:

$ make DESTDIR=/tmp install

You can generate RDoc documentation as follows:

$ rdoc -x CVS rbcrack.c lib

This will generate HTML and documentation in the doc/ subdirectory.
